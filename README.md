This mod is NOT OFFICIAL
im just some guy that wanted to play singleplayer.

This mod adds the legacy structures from the old Crafting Dead to the new 1.16.5 Crafting Dead with loot spawns.
Without any loot the singleplayer and custom hosted games are unplayable because some items are non-craftable an require to be looted.
With this mod its possible to play singleplayer or host your own servers that have loot spawns.

Just create a world like you would normally do and enjoy.
For servers install the mod like you would normally and structure generation should work.

If you want to do a custom worldgen json file here are the structure id's for configuration:

   cd_worldgen:run_down_base
   cd_worldgen:run_down_bunker
   cd_worldgen:run_down_house
   cd_worldgen:run_down_tower
